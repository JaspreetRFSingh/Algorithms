# Algorithms
Java implementation of the most common algorithms. </br>
All the algorithms are implemented in Java-8. </br>


Feel free to ask any queries or logic behind the implemented algorithms.

*P.S.* - Though this repository is for self-practice, any suggestions(pull requests) on making the algorithm **more** efficient are welcomed. </br>
